Routes are a like pages that can be traveled to through anywhere.
Two routes --> Anonymous & Named.

Anonymous ones can't be reused since they don't have names or strings through which
can refer them.

Named routes can be reused and they have their names -- strings -- through which can
refer them.
Upon calling the routes through their name, they will call a builder function.
that will build the view you wanted.

That's what they do, they take a string and a builder function as their input.

And hey guess what they are, they are Maps , aka Dictionaries.
they contain key-value pairs.
